# smsbomber

This script allows you to send automated emails from your Gmail, ProtonMail, or Hotmail account.

## Prerequisites

You need Python 3 and the `smtplib` library installed on your machine. 

To check if Python is installed, open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Linux) and type:

```bash
python --version
```

You should see some version of Python 3.x. If Python is not installed, please install it from the official website: https://www.python.org/

To install `smtplib`, it's included in the Python standard library, so you don't need to install it separately.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   Windows or Linux:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RocketGod-git/smsbomber.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory where the repository is cloned.

   Windows or Linux:
   ```
   cd smsbomber
   ```

## Usage

To run the script, type:

Windows:
```
python smsbomber.py
```

Linux:
```bash
python3 smsbomber.py
```

Follow the prompts to select your email provider, enter your email address and password, the target email address, the number of emails to send, and the wait time between each email.

## Important Notice

Please be aware that using scripts to send automated emails can violate the terms of service of your email provider and can also be considered spamming, which is illegal in many jurisdictions. This kind of activity can lead to your email account being suspended or terminated, and may also have other legal consequences.
